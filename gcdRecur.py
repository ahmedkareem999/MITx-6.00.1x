Week-2:Exercise-gcd Recur
The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides each of them without remainder. For example,

gcd(2, 12) = 2

gcd(6, 12) = 6

gcd(9, 12) = 3

gcd(17, 12) = 1

A clever mathematical trick (due to Euclid) makes it easy to find greatest common divisors. Suppose that a and b are two positive integers:

If b = 0, then the answer is a

Otherwise, gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(b, a % b)

See this website for an example of Euclid's algorithm being used to find the gcd.

Write a function gcdRecur(a, b) that implements this idea recursively. This function takes in two positive integers and returns one integer.

#code
def gcdRecur(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers
    
    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    # Your code here
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcdRecur(b,a % b)
